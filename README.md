# Skin-cancer-detection-as-Novelty-detection

For this project, the dataset is obtained from https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T <\br>
the classes in this dataset contains both cancerous and benign images , therefore I considered benign images as seen dataset and malignant as novel dataset <\br>
dataset preparation can be found in the main file <\br>
One class novelty detection models is to be used, there are papers like https://github.com/PramuPerera/OCGAN and https://github.com/podgorskiy/GPND available  <\br>
But for this I have used my own model and achieved AUC score of 0.77 which is high values when compared to performance of one class novlety detection model's performance on CIFAR-10 dataset <\br>
Right Now , I am working on writing a paper therefore after that I will post the full model with the data prep code.
